Interactive Data Exploration Using NLP
This project demonstrates how to perform interactive data exploration using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It leverages Flask for the web interface and NLTK for NLP tasks. Users can input text data and explore the most common words through a simple web interface.

Project Overview
This project enables users to:

Input text and analyze it for word frequency.
Use a pre-built CSV file for data analysis.
Explore the text in a Jupyter Notebook for more detailed analysis.
The main functionalities include tokenizing the text and finding the most frequent words using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

Features
Interactive Text Exploration: Users can submit text via a web interface and receive insights into the most common words.
Word Frequency Analysis: The Flask app processes text to display the top 10 most frequent words.
Jupyter Notebook for Exploration: For in-depth data exploration, the Jupyter notebook is available to visualize token frequency.
Technologies Used
Flask: Web framework used for building the application.
Pandas: Data manipulation and CSV handling.
NLTK: Natural Language Processing toolkit for tokenizing and frequency analysis.
HTML/CSS: Front-end to display the input form and results.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration.
